# Awesome Portfolio Performance

This is an incomplete collection of repositories that add on top of [Portfolio Performance](https://github.com/buchen/portfolio), a simple tool to calculate the overall performance of an investment portfolio.

The list was moved to the Portfolio Performance Forum and can be found here: https://forum.portfolio-performance.info/t/portfolio-performance-collection-of-useful-tools/24254

In case you have suggestions on how to improve it, please edit it in the forum or create an issue in this repository.
