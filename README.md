# Awesome Portfolio Performance

This is an incomplete collection of repositories that add on top of [Portfolio Performance](https://github.com/buchen/portfolio), a simple tool to calculate the overall performance of an investment portfolio.

Note: I am not affiliated with Portfolio Performance, I just started this list. Feel free to create a PR to add to or edit this list!


*Edit*: The list was moved to the Portfolio Performance Forum and can be found here: https://forum.portfolio-performance.info/t/portfolio-performance-collection-of-useful-tools/24254 - in case you have suggestions how to improve it, please edit it in the forum or create an issue in this repository.
